A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil
[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6373/320]

Here we provide:
- Table S1 [aap9516_Table_S1_v2.xlsx] - List of identified dominant bacterial phylotypes from soils across the globe. This list contains information on the taxonomic identity of each phylotype, the ecological cluster it was assigned to, and the most closely related reference genome, cultivated strain and isolate.
- Data spreasheets [Dataset_01_22_2018.xlsx] - There are four spreadsheets with data.
-- The spreadsheet "Dominant_taxa" contains information on the abundance for dominant bacterial taxa.
-- The spreadsheet "Dominant_taxa_metadata" contains the associated metadata, where a description of all the variables and units can be found.
-- The spreadsheet "Environmental_data" contains all the environmental data used in this study.
-- The spreadsheet "Environmental_data_metadata" contains the associated metadata, where a description of all the variables and units can be found.
