Here we provide OTUs abundances for matching 16S and WGS samples from:
'Urban Transit System Microbial Communities Differ by Surface Type and Interaction with Humans and the Environment'
[https://msystems.asm.org/content/1/3/e00018-16]

File 'BostonPilot_S1_subset.xlsx' contains subset of metadata from Table S1 for samples which have been sequnced both with 16S and WGS approaches. We have extended the metatable by SRA identifiers.

File 'BostonPilot_S2_subset.xlsx' contains subset of OTUs abundances from Table S2 for samples which have been sequnced both with 16S and WGS approaches.

For detailed description of Tables S1 and S2 please refere to:
